abstract: 'Intersection over Union (IoU) is an important function in object detection based on deep learning. But, there is a gap between the used distance losses and this metric value of maximizing. This paper improves the IoU function based on IoU. Redesigned the neural network structure, and used the PASCAL VOC2012 dataset. The structure model of the neural network is compare with others in the accuracy of object detection. Experimental results show that our method can achieve good results in object detection. The approach provides a new idea for object detection.'
